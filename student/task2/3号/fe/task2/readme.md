# Todo (Front End) 

## Iteration II
### Introduction
I pick up this from one of your work and decide to make your next mission based on it. I am confused how much work is okay and still an exciting challenge. And this time the work is less complex and mainly to let you figure it out how to interact with backend server.

### Tasks
The register part is done and the rest is up to you, including: login and CRUD for todo, all these should use backend
1. login and logout
2. check todo list
3. add todo, modify todo, check todo, delete todo
4. if has session, system should remember current user instead of requiring login again after refreshing the browser

### Questions(a readme.md file should be included when you submit your work)
1. what is fetch
2. callback and promise, which is preferred when it comes to async operation
3. figure out those concepts: HTTP, HTTP Status Code (200, 401, 403, 404, 500)
4. what are the bad/unsatisfying/disturbing parts of this frontend project(for example, why writing just one global css file instead of one for each), and advice on how to improve it or avoid it, or what would you like? list what you have gotten in mind. (not a question, it's a discussion)

### ps
Some may have noticed that we use both jsdoc and typescript. Jsdoc is not something we need to know much about, but typescript is currently popular and next project it's included in
