# Todo (Front End) 

## Iteration II(not done yet)
### Introduction
I pick up this from one of your work and decide to make your next mission based on it. I am confused how much work is okay and still an exciting challenge. And this time the work is less complex and mainly to let you know how to interact with backend server.

### Tasks
The register part is done and the rest is up to you, including: login and CRUD for todo, all these should use backend
1. login and logout
2. check todo list
3. add todo, modify todo, check todo, delete todo
4. if has session, system should remember current user instead of requiring login again after refreshing

### Questions(a readme.md file should be included when you submit your work)
1. relation between fetch and XMLHttpRequest
2. callback and promise, which is preferred when it comes to async operation
3. figure out those concepts: HTTP, HTTP Status Code (200, 401, 403, 404, 500)
4. what are the bad/unsatisfying/disturbing parts of this frontend project, and how to improve it or avoid it? list what you have gotten in mind. (NOT a question, it's a discussion)
